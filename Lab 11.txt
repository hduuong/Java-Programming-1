1) 

	private java.util.ArrayList<String> reindeer;

2) 

	public Reindeer (){
    	  reindeer = new java.util.ArrayList<String>();

3) 

	deer.reindeer = new java.util.LinkedList<String>();

4)

	bases on the outputs from the two list, there is no difference between them.

5) 

	when the second add and print methods are called for the LinkedList, it print a new list
	with all the names but this time it linked to the previous list of names. SO we have 2 sets
	of names in the third list.

6) 

	deer.reindeer = new java.util.HashSet<String>();

7)

	yes, the order of names are rearranged in the HASHSET.

8) How does the behavior of the List and Set differ?

	Bases on the outputs, List allows user to add the objects in the order of which the objects
	are inserted while HashSet does not. Set does not allow dupplicate objects. 

9) Give the new implementation for the print method.

  public void print() {
    java.util.Iterator<String> it = reindeer.iterator();
    while(it.hasNext()){
      System.out.print(it.next() + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
  }
