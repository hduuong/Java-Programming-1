Lab 4 : Snowman's Hat

1) However, it would not work if you replaced both of the constructors with the code above. Why?

  Because it will cause 'recursive constructor invocation' error.
  There will a confusion in calling the method. If replacing both constructors that way, the call
  statement will cause it to go back and forth between 2 contructors and it will never get to call
  the buildSnowman method.

2) What happens when you call removeHat?

  the hat disappears from the window.

3) After you call removeHat, what happens if you call moveHatBy?

  notthing happen to the window and an error occurs.

4) What happens if you add two hats? After you have added two hats, can you manipulate (move) them both? Explain why.
  
  2 hats appear on the window. And I cannot move them both.
  Because the 'moveHatBy' method can only change the position of one hat, since the setLocation
  can only apply to one variable infront of the dot.

5) This new class should be a subclass of NsccComponent. Explain why.

  because this new class need to recieve the necessary properties from NsccComponent class
  inorder to add new state and behavior to create a new hat.

6) Explain why it is unlikely that you will create your hat with the underlying NsccComponent being too small.

  because the size of the hat is restricted by the size of NsccComponent,
  if the size of the hat is bigger than the size of NsccComponent, the hat can only be shown
  as the maximun size of NsccComponent.
  Usually we make the size of NsccComponent big enough to create a hat in it so that this 
  wont happen
