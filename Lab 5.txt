Lab 5: Vertical Alignment

1) How many methods are in VertAlign?
  
  there are 7 methods

2) What is the difference between method1 and method2? In functionality? In formatting?

  statements in method1 has indentation while method2 has not.
  there is no no difference in functionality.

3) What is the difference between method2 and method3? Does this change make a difference in readability?

  the close bracket in methods 3 close at the same line as the last statements.
  this change actually makes it easier to read since the extra blank lines with only the close
  bracket on the line.
 
4) What happened when you pressed the tab key with lines 13 - 21 selected?

  it was pushed in in the same order of indentation as method1.

5) See if you can figure out what the editor is using to determine the vertical alignment in the code for method5

  the editor tries to line up the statements. although the statements are broken down in another
  line, the editor indents the broken statesment to make it still seems continuous with the other
  half.

6) What's going on around line 56?

  it has the remaining of the return statement of method6, and has only the modifier of 
  the method k. this line ends one method and starts another one.
