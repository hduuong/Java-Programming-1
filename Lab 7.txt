Lab 7: Scanner

1) What is the advantage of declaring scan as a field, rather than a local variable?

  so scan can be used in every method within this class (acts like a global variable).

2) What does this method do if you press the return key multiple times in response to the prompt?

  it creates a new blank blocks for user to enter words in.

3) What does this method do if you enter two-word values, like "peanut butter", "ice cream", "hot dog"?

  it echoes back both words but not at a same time (same line). it considers user enters a 
  2-words values as enters each word seperately. it echoes 1st word as word 1, and 2nd word as
  word 2.

4) What does this method do if you enter a sentence, like "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."?

  it echoes back the first 5 words out of the entire sentence, 1 in each line. The rest are not
  echoed due to the end of a loop.

5) How does the method handle a real number or a non-numeric value?

  If user inputs the real number, it echoes back that number and store/add up into the total
  variable. Until finish the loop, it shows the total of the real number inputs.
  If user inputs a non-numeric value, it shows error messages.

6) How does the method handle integer input?

  It automatically convert Int into a Double.
