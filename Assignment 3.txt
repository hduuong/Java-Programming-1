Assignment 3 : Report
4/17/12
How did you approach (get started with) this assignment?
  
  i read through the intruction and started writing step by step.

What works and what doesn't work?

  the methods that draw a normal board and colored board work well.
  it takes a while to figure out how to draw line with thickness since there're no setSize or whatsoever

What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?

  I had a hard time to think how to draw line with thickness and how to rotate.

What did you learn from this assignment? What would you do differently next time?
  
  I learn how to write mothods that use params passed down to complete a task(s).
  I learn to get used to field and constructor
  I would think of other ways to approach the problem rather than just think of one that takes
  me a lot of time.

explain why the NsccWindow reference should be a field while the NsccLine reference(s) should not

  because NsccWindow need to be shared in between methods, while NsccLine is different in every
  method. NsccLine is not consitant throughout the program.

explain the rationale for making the NsccWindow field private, rather than public.

  because it needs protecion from others who are not the programmer. When a field is private,
  the caller cannot get inappropriate direct access to the field. field contains variables that
  are shared to different methods, so must prevent callers to make any changes.
