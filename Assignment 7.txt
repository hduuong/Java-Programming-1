Assignment 7 : Report

how did you go about starting this project?

  I start with write up the minimal version and then think of how to check the input is a valid
  integer. Later then I just go with whatever seems logical in my mind.

what works and what doesn’t?

  At first I try to have a test case with a number and a word stick together like "1plus"
  but this is not a good test case so I ignore it and everything works fine.

did the test cases help you verify the correctness of your results?

  yes, it helps me to not make up a test case that would make my codes a lot more complicated.

the surprises or problems you encountered while implementing this application

  I had some trouble with displacing the output in a proper order, but I figured out how to fix it

the most important thing(s) you learned from this assignment

  the most important thing that I learnt from this assignment is that I could check if a string 
  is a integer. I works better with loops.

what you would do differently next time?

  I would not think of the test case that is not make sense
  and keep up with the good work.
