how did you go about starting this project?

  I start with finding out how to calculate the factorial of a number and write a method for it

what works and what doesn’t?

  I finish the minimal version but could not know how to format it into a check version

did the test cases help you verify the correctness of your results?
  
  yes, it did.

the surprises or problems you encountered while implementing this application

  I don't know how to format each line differently while the lines are made in a loop.

the most important thing(s) you learned from this assignment

  It is hard for me to learn anything new from this assignment since I don't know how to do it
  But it is helpful when I did the scanner method. It helps me to review that stuffs.

what you would do differently next time?

  I need to be more careful in starting the assignment and making a blueprint for direction.
